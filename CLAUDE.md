# Kleio — working notes for Claude

Personal web app to chronicle D&D campaigns: session notes + 5E character sheets, grouped
under campaigns. Read `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/roadmap.md` for the full design; this
file is the quick, durable reference. Keep it updated as the code lands.

## Themed naming (important)
- **`herald/`** = the **frontend** (Angular). "Announces & presents."
- **`oracle/`** = the **backend** (FastAPI). "Holds the answers."

Use these names in code, paths, and prose. `frontend`/`backend` appear in docs only as
one-word glosses.

## Git workflow (do this)
- **Start every new feature/task on a new branch** — create it before making changes; never
  work directly on `main`.
- **Never stage or commit.** Leave all `git add` / `git commit` to the user — they review the
  diff before the PR stage to avoid redundant CI runs. Make the edits, then stop and let them
  commit.

## Layout
```
herald/    Angular SPA
oracle/    FastAPI app + Alembic migrations + tests
infra/     docker-compose (dev + prod), nginx config
docs/      architecture.md, roadmap.md  (source of truth for design)
```

## Conventions & gotchas (don't violate without reason)
- **Derived character stats are computed, never stored.** Ability modifiers, proficiency
  bonus, saving throws, skills, passive perception, initiative are calculated from the
  manually-entered fields. All the math lives in one **pure** module,
  `oracle/app/services/character_calc.py` (no DB/IO) so it's exhaustively unit-tested.
  **The backend is authoritative**; the frontend may mirror the math for live preview only.
- **Notes are Markdown.** `raw_notes` is the canonical text the user writes and is **always
  preserved**; `summary` is a separate, nullable, editable field (filled by Gemini later).
- **Single-user auth.** One credential from env (`APP_USERNAME`, `APP_PASSWORD_HASH`,
  `JWT_SECRET`); JWT bearer token on all data routes. No signup/multi-user.
- **Database is PostgreSQL** (+ `pgvector`, reserved for the later AI Q&A). One engine for
  relational data, full-text search, and embeddings. Migrations via **Alembic**.
- **Styling = Tailwind CSS v4 + Zard UI** (shadcn-style), **not** Angular Material. Zard
  components are added with `npx zard-cli add <name>` (init is interactive: `npx zard-cli init`)
  and are **copied into `herald/src/app/components/` (alias `@/components`) and committed** —
  treat them as our source, not a dependency. Helpers live in `@/utils` (e.g. `cn` /
  `merge-classes`) and Zard runtime directives in `@/core`; `@/*` maps to `src/app/*`. Requires
  Tailwind v4 and **plain CSS (no SCSS)** — `herald` is scaffolded with `--style=css`. Angular
  CDK is allowed for layout/`BreakpointObserver` only. Gotcha: after `zard-cli add card`, fix
  its `@/shared/core` import to `@/core` (beta CLI bug).
- **Split component files:** template, styles, and logic live in **separate files** —
  `templateUrl`/`styleUrl`, never inline `template:`/`styles:`. `ng generate component` already
  does this by default. **Zard components from `zard-cli add` come with inline template/styles
  — extract them** into `.html`/`.css` and switch to `templateUrl`/`styleUrl` after adding
  (see `components/button` and `components/card` for the pattern). Directives (e.g. `input`)
  have no template and need no split.
- **Frontend testing:** unit runner is **Vitest** (not Karma/Jasmine); spec files are **not
  auto-generated** (`skipTests: true` in `angular.json`) — write them by hand when wanted.
  End-to-end is Playwright (added in Phase 2). Backend tests are Pytest.
- **Split view is desktop-only** by design; mobile degrades to stacked/tabbed navigation.
- **Secrets live in `.env`** (gitignored). See `.env.example` for the full list. Never commit
  real secrets.

## Commands
_Filled in during Phase 0 scaffolding. Intended shape:_
- Backend tests: `cd oracle && pytest`
- Backend lint: `cd oracle && ruff check .`
- Frontend build: `cd herald && ng build`
- Frontend e2e: `cd herald && npx playwright test`
- Local stack: `docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up`
- Migrations: `cd oracle && alembic upgrade head`

## Status
Planning done, docs committed. Next: **Phase 0** (scaffold herald + oracle, local Postgres,
single-user auth, CI). See `docs/roadmap.md`.
